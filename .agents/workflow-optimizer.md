```

**Current Projects:**
- **COT System**: Device monitoring, alerts, reporting → Extract monitoring microservice
- **FMS Platform**: Vehicle tracking, fleet management → Extract fleet microservice
- **Integration APIs**: External system connectors → Extract API gateway service

### **Track 2: SaaS Development (Future Revenue)**

```

**SaaS Components:**
- **Universal Monitoring Service**: From COT patterns
- **Fleet Management Service**: From FMS patterns
- **Notification Service**: From alert system patterns
- **Reporting Engine**: From both projects
