    A[COT Monitoring] --> B[Pattern Extraction]
    C[FMS Integration] --> B
    B --> D[Universal Components]
    D --> E[SaaS Foundation]
```

**Current Projects:**
- **COT System**: Device monitoring, alerts, reporting → Extract monitoring microservice
- **FMS Platform**: Vehicle tracking, fleet management → Extract fleet microservice
- **Integration APIs**: External system connectors → Extract API gateway service

### **Track 2: SaaS Development (Future Revenue)**

    B --> C[Cloud Architecture]
    C --> D[MVP Launch]
    D --> E[$100K/month Goal]
```

**SaaS Components:**
- **Universal Monitoring Service**: From COT patterns
- **Fleet Management Service**: From FMS patterns
- **Notification Service**: From alert system patterns
- **Reporting Engine**: From both projects

## 💡 Pattern Extraction Engine

### **Automatic Pattern Detection**
```php
// Pattern detection service
class PatternExtractionService
{
    public function analyzeCodeChanges(array $files): PatternAnalysis
    {
        $patterns = [];

        foreach ($files as $file) {
            // Detect service patterns
            if ($this->isServiceClass($file)) {
                $patterns[] = $this->extractServicePattern($file);
            }

            // Detect API patterns
            if ($this->isControllerClass($file)) {
                $patterns[] = $this->extractApiPattern($file);
            }

            // Detect entity patterns
            if ($this->isEntityClass($file)) {
                $patterns[] = $this->extractEntityPattern($file);
            }
        }

        return new PatternAnalysis($patterns);
    }

    private function extractServicePattern(string $file): ServicePattern
    {
        // Extract business logic patterns for universal use
        return new ServicePattern([
            'contract_implementation' => $this->parseContractCode($file),
            'universal_equivalent' => $this->generateUniversalCode($file),
            'saas_value' => $this->calculateSaasValue($file)
        ]);
    }
}
```

### **Universal Component Generator**
```php
// Generate SaaS-ready components from contract code
class UniversalComponentGenerator
{
    public function generateFromContract(string $contractService): UniversalService
    {
        return new UniversalService([
            'multi_tenant' => true,
            'scalable' => true,
            'configurable' => true,
            'source_pattern' => $contractService
        ]);
    }
}
```
